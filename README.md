# ✨ Automation Project with n8n – Streamlining Order & Inventory Management

I recently built an end-to-end automation workflow using n8n to connect Telegram Bot with Google Sheets, helping to manage orders and inventory with zero manual effort.

# Key Features:

Automated Inventory Updates:
Each new order automatically updates stock levels in Google Sheets (e.g., laptops, phones, tablets).

Order Registration via Form:
Customers can submit their name, item, and phone number through a form → the data is instantly logged in the sheet.

# Order Status Processing:
Using a Switch Case workflow, orders are dynamically updated:

✅ Done when the order is completed.

❌ Canceled when the order is rejected or withdrawn.

# 🔹 Impact:

Eliminated repetitive manual data entry.

Improved accuracy in stock tracking.

Streamlined the order lifecycle from request → logging → processing.
